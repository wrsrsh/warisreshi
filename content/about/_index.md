i live in the beautiful city of [srinagar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinagar) and work at [asent](https://www.asent.app) as a humble co-founder ;)

interested in

- **technology.** my life's core mission; using technology to support and uplift human potential â€” across communication, health, endurance, learning, and everyday life.

- **artificial intelligence.** what i do at [asent](https://www.asent.app); building interpersonal communication systems, essentially replacing highly detailed, researched and time-consuming conversations with a click of a button while maintaining the same quality.

- **entrepreneurship.** investing in people to build their own businesses, whether it is a startup, a side hustle, or a freelance gig.
- **human performance.** whether it is being a [runner](https://www.strava.com/athletes/129500060), strength training, climbing mountains, or dreaming about ultramarathons, i am interested.
- **mathematics & physics.** the driving force behind my pursuit of understanding the universe, from understanding fundamental laws to developing new technologies that take us closer to the edge of the cosmos.

anything interesting? i'm on socials as @wrsrsh or drop me an email at [waris@asent.app](waris@asent.app)
